# Glasses guy plugin

Just a simple Wordpress plugin to show a guy with glasses

## How it works

To use this plugin, you just need active it (of course). In editor, you will see a custom block is `Glasses guy`. In this block, you can fill a message for this guy, set some styling (text color, background color, text align...) and name of this guy.

In blog view, this block will display a guy with his message like this:
```
[Guy] ( ∙_∙)>⌐■-■ :
Some message...
```

To make him wear this glasses, you only need fill his name in toggle `Who wear glasses?`. In this case, this guy will wear his glasses.

```
[Guy] (⌐■-■) :
It's so dark!
```

## I built it with

- `Parceljs` to complice code
- Wordpress gutenberg blocks

## Development

```
yarn install
yarn start
```
